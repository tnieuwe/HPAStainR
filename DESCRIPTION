Description: This package is built around the HPAStainR function. The purpose of
    the HPAStainR function is to query the visual staining data in the Human
    Protein Atlas to return a table of staining ranked cell types. The function
    also has multiple arguments to personalize to output as well to include
    cancer data, csv readable names, modify the confidence levels of the results
    and more. The other functions exist exclusively to easily acquire the data
    required to run HPAStainR.
